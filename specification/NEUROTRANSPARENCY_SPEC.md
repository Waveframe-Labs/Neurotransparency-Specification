# Neurotransparency Specification (NTS) v2.0.0
*Normative Disclosure Requirements for Cognitive Influence in AI–Human Systems*

## Introduction — Specification Position & Authority

This document defines the **Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)** — a **normative compliance specification** governing the disclosure of epistemically relevant AI influence in AI–human scientific and technical artifacts.

NTS specifies **what must be disclosed** for an artifact to be considered epistemically legitimate under Neurotransparency. It does not define why these requirements exist, how they are operationalized, or how they are enforced.

---

### Nature of the Specification

NTS is a **structural disclosure standard**.

It defines:
- minimum attribution requirements for AI involvement,
- minimum provenance and reconstruction expectations,
- explicit failure conditions for epistemic legitimacy.

NTS does **not**:
- prescribe workflows,
- mandate tools, vendors, or models,
- require access to internal model reasoning,
- enforce compliance mechanically,
- evaluate scientific correctness or merit.

Compliance with NTS is binary: required disclosures either exist and are coherent, or they do not.

---

### Position Within the Aurora Stack

NTS occupies the **normative disclosure layer** of the Aurora governance stack.

Its role is strictly bounded:

- **Neurotransparency Doctrine (NTD)**  
  Defines *why* cognitive traceability is required for epistemic legitimacy.

- **Neurotransparency Specification (NTS)**  
  Defines *what must be disclosed* when AI or other non-local cognition influences claims or decisions.

- **Aurora Research Initiative (ARI)**  
  Adopts NTS as a binding standard and determines institutional legitimacy and consequences.

- **Aurora Workflow Orchestration (AWO)**  
  Defines *when* and *where* NTS-compliant artifacts are produced within workflows.

- **CRI-CORE**  
  Determines *whether* required NTS artifacts exist and enforces declared constraints mechanically.

NTS does not override or substitute for any other layer.  
If NTS attempts to answer *why*, *when*, *how*, or *whether*, it is operating out of scope.

---

### Authority and Adoption

NTS has **no inherent enforcement authority**.

Its authority derives exclusively from:
- formal adoption by an institution (e.g., ARI), or
- explicit declaration by a project, workflow, or artifact.

Once adopted, NTS requirements are **non-optional** for all claim-affecting cognition within scope. Selective or partial compliance is not considered valid.

NTS governs disclosure obligations only.  
Judgment, enforcement, and remediation are defined downstream.

---

### Normative Boundary

NTS establishes a single normative boundary:

> Cognition that materially influences a claim or decision must be externally attributable and reconstructible at a summary level.

NTS does not require exposure of internal reasoning, raw prompts, or proprietary model details. It requires only the minimum information necessary to make epistemic influence **discoverable, auditable, and human-owned**.

This boundary preserves legitimacy without mandating surveillance or interpretability.

---

### Relationship to Scientific Legitimacy

NTS does not evaluate:
- correctness,
- rigor,
- novelty,
- or empirical validity.

It evaluates **epistemic legitimacy only**.

An artifact may be scientifically correct and still be non-compliant with NTS.  
Conversely, NTS compliance does not imply correctness — only that the influence of AI-assisted cognition is transparently disclosed and attributable.
