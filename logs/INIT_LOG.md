## Re-Initialization & Major Revision — v2.0.0

**Re-initialized:** 2025-12-16  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Status:** Active  

### Scope of Re-Initialization

This re-initialization reflects a **major normative revision** of the Neurotransparency Specification, transitioning from an early disclosure framework (v1.x) to a fully formalized **normative compliance specification** governing epistemic transparency in AI–human workflows.

No prior artifacts were deleted or rewritten; all changes were applied via revision and supersession in accordance with ARI governance rules.

### Actions Performed

- Revised and finalized `NEUROTRANSPARENCY_SPEC.md` to v2.0.0:
  - Formalized binary compliance model
  - Defined cognitive influence threshold
  - Codified human epistemic authority invariant
  - Established reconstruction-over-replay principle
  - Clarified separation from NTD, AWO, and CRI-CORE
- Added `specification/NTS_descriptor.yml` describing the canonical specification artifact
- Added `figures/descriptor.yml` describing non-normative visual assets
- Reviewed and normalized metadata across all governed files for ARI-Metadata-2.0.0 compliance
- Prepared repository for v2.0.0 release tagging and DOI minting

### Governance Notes

- v1.1.0 remains valid as a historical artifact but is superseded by v2.0.0
- This log records *structural and governance actions only*  
  Normative content is defined exclusively in the specification itself
